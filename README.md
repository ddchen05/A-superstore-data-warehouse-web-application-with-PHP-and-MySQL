# A Web Database Application with PHP and MySQL
### Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze, specify, design, and implement a data warehouse for 
an up-and-coming computer and electronics store called S&Eâ€™s Technology Superstore. The 
project will proceed in three phases as outlined in the Classical Methodology for Database 
Development: Analysis & Specification, Design, and Implementation & Testing. The system 
will be implemented using a Database Management System (DBMS) that supports standard 
SQL queries. 
### Repository layout
This project is delivered in 3 phases.

Phase 1:

The Extended Entity Relationship (EER) map for the S&E Store

A detailed Report with data types, task decomposition, and abstract code.

Phase 2:

The updated EER map

The EER to Relational Database table mapping

Full schema of the Relational Database with all tables and constraints

A report which has translated Phase1 abstract code into SQL queries

Phase 3: 

All the implementation code for this project.
### UI interface
The local database is hosted on the WAMP server.
#### Dashboard
The main menu screen  can be used to access all functionality of the system that has been described in this specification. On this main menu, the following
statistics should be displayed along with any buttons/links to reports or functionalities: the count of stores, manufacturers, products, and managers in the data warehouse.
